# Personal Experimental Works

A livestream index made on top of the "Saturnella" platform.  My friend Andrew Loutfi made an endpoint that aggregates data from multiple sources and I present it.

[intothevoid.world](intothevoid.world) a bunch of broken links.  This used to be my portfolio aggregation.

[saturnella.com](saturnella.com).  Nothing too interesting, yet.  Has a catalan noun rules engine that I made for fun.


All of these projects are made on top of a progressively enhanced "Saturnella" platform-- a React/Typescript/Webkit starter project that is being recycled and upgraded. The following are in order of implementation.

[Theme switching](https://t.co/LTMByZW3fn?amp=1)

[Reusable interface with simple action](https://competent-mayer-5ca6c6.netlify.app). Click the button a bunch of times and see that the app has some state.

Experimenting with vertically repeating SVGs and Animations.

Real projects:

Paul Kraft MPLS (unfortunately, this project fell through, but I still made good progress with a gatsby app)

My Japan Trip final project when I was in college.  This was made with compiled SCSS and HTML.  No JS.  I lost the source code unfortunately.
